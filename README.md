Welcome!
As a new developer I am trying out different techniques with projects.
Here I have developed a Content Management System (CMS). This is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. It is intended to manage the deptartments, roles and employees in a company.

## ü™Ñ User Story
```
**GIVEN** a command-line application that accepts user input

**WHEN** I start the application

**THEN** I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

**WHEN** I choose to view all departments

**THEN** I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

**WHEN** I choose to view all roles

**THEN** I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

**WHEN** I choose to view all employees

**THEN** I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

**WHEN** I choose to add a department

**THEN** I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

**WHEN** I choose to add a role

**THEN** I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

**WHEN** I choose to add an employee

**THEN** I am prompted to enter the employee‚Äôs first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

**WHEN** I choose to update an employee role

**THEN** I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
```
